Building from the work of scientists such as B.F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov, applied behavior analysis uses behavioral methodologies to improve the quality of life of clients by teaching new skills and redirecting maladaptive behaviors. 

Applied behavior analysis stresses the importance of data collection with frequent charting and analysis. Interventions are both applied and continually reevaluated based on this data. Eschewing the hypothetical constructs and statistical approximations of psychology, behaviorists treat individual behaviors as worth the merit of study and use the visual analysis of trends and levels in data to support their experimental control.
