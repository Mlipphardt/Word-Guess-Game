Steps for creating a Word Guessing Game

1. Computer must select a word to be guessed.
2. User must be shown underscores that are the length of the word the computer selects.
3. User must be shown how many guesses they have before they lose.
4. User must be able to input guesses either upper or lowercase using keyboard keys.
5. Guesses made so far must be shown to the user.
6. When the allowable guesses hit 0, a count of wins and losses must update, and the game should reset.
